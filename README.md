# Voxopolis Rewritten - Made in Godot Mono v4.4.1
Voxopolis Rewritten began with the goal of creating a better and more optimized version of Voxopolis. However, I have failed to deliver a finished product. This was by far the best learning experience I've ever had. I found Voxopolis and Voxopolis Rewritten to be both fun and challenging to work on. If you're reading this, feel free to do anything with the source code of this project.

I'm sorry for leaving such an unfinished and half-baked project, but I've lost all the motivation and commitment I ever had for this project.

Also, I did use some AI Assistance with some stuff, including the player controller, but not a big part of it, just the math behind rotating the player.

Nearly forgot, but, the sky shader is not made by me, i got it from https://godotshaders.com/
